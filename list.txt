Bitcoin API：This is a C++ wrapper library for JSON-RPC communication with the Bitcoin daemon. It allows developers to communicate with the Bitcoin daemon without the need to pack and unpack JSON-RPC messages and thus simplifies the interaction with it.

"The use of these crypto techniques for building a tamper-resistant database has been known for 25 years. At first there wasn’t much impetus for Wall Street to pay attention, but gradually there has arisen a great opportunity in moving some types of financial infrastructure to an automated, cryptographically secured model."
